# Spring Books -  GraphQL

This is a demo project that will introduce you to [https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql](Spring for GraphQL). 
The Spring Boot application uses Spring for GraphQL and creates a single endpoint at `/graphql` for all GraphQL queries.
If you want to test out the application you can use the GraphiQL UI located at http://localhost:8080/graphiql


## Development 

- Run the Spring Boot application which will run on port 8080
- Run the Vue application (/src/frontend) with the command `npm run dev` and it will start up on port 3000
